## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Alejandro Mac Carthy
I am a passionate developer looking for opportunities to apply and expand my skills. Although I am new in the professional field, I have invested time and effort in acquiring solid knowledge both at Digital House and self-taught.
In addition to my technical skills, I consider myself a creative, proactive person and a good communicator. I love challenging myself to reach new goals and go further. In other words, I don't set limits to myself or make excuses.
